# Purpose 

This project is to simulate an instrument that implements SCPI or other commands, 
such as most instruments from Keysight, Agilent or Rohde & Schwarz.

Currently, only communication over the Socket protocol is supported.

These instruments normally attached using GPIB or LAN. LAN instruments usually use socket, 
but GPIB doesn't.
